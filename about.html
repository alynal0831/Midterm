                    <img src="img/office.jpg" alt="RealHome Realty office front" width="600" height="280" class="responsive">
                    <p>Founded in 1998 by local real estate professionals, RealHome Realty grew from a small family-run office into a trusted neighbourhood partner. Our mission has always been to help families find homes where they can build memories for generations.</p>
                    <p>We intentionally focus only on single-family residential properties so our agents can be experts in lot sizes, school districts, and community amenities â€” the details that matter most to homeowners.</p>

                    <h3>What Sets Us Apart</h3>
                    <img src="img/team.jpg" alt="RealHome Realty team" width="400" height="200" class="responsive">
                    <p>Our agents live and work in the communities they serve. That local knowledge, combined with transparent pricing and proactive communication, makes the buying and selling process less stressful and more predictable.</p>
                    <p>We also provide complimentary market reports, staging advice, and a network of preferred lenders and inspectors to streamline each transaction.</p>
