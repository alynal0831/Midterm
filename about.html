                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <img src="img/front-of-realhome-building.jpg" alt="RealHome Realty office front" width="600" height="280" class="responsive float-left">
                    <p>Founded in 1998 by a small group of passionate local real estate professionals, RealHome Realty began as a family-run office with one simple goal: to help families find not just a house, but a place to truly call home. Over the years, our dedication to honesty, integrity, and personalized service allowed us to grow from a humble neighborhood agency into a trusted name in real estate throughout the region.</p>
                    <p>From the beginning, our mission has been clear — to connect families with homes where they can build memories that last for generations. Whether it’s watching children take their first steps in a cozy living room, hosting backyard barbecues, or enjoying quiet evenings on the porch, we understand that the right home sets the stage for life’s most meaningful moments.</p>
                    <p>At RealHome Realty, we intentionally focus exclusively on single-family residential properties. This specialization allows our agents to become true neighborhood experts — understanding the details that make each community unique, from lot sizes and architectural styles to school districts, local parks, and nearby amenities. Our commitment ensures that every recommendation we make is backed by deep local knowledge and a genuine understanding of what families value most.</p>
                    <p>Today, RealHome Realty is proud to remain locally owned and community-focused. Many of our agents are lifelong residents themselves — parents, volunteers, and neighbors who care deeply about the communities we serve. We believe that finding the right home isn’t just a transaction; it’s a partnership built on trust, compassion, and expertise.</p>
                    <p>As we continue to grow, our vision remains the same:</p>
                    <p>To help every family discover the place where they truly belong — a RealHome that feels like home.</p>
